## Abstract

A number of international and national studies have demonstrated that an ageing population will bring great logistical and economical challenges for the United Kingdom and the world as a whole. As it stands right now the demand for social care services in the United Kingdom is set to increase.

The Social Care Application intends to bridge the technological gap between care workers, the people responsible for delivering care, and care managers, the people responsible for making decisions in the best interests of the client.

This report highlights the most common issues in the daily work cycle of a care worker to streamline required reporting. To achieve this, both primary and secondary research was gathered in order to build the requirements of the application so that it meets the demands of care workers and care manager alike.

To this objective, I have built a system that compromises an Android application that fetches information using a script as an intermediary to the database. In turn, the database is updated using a website management system so that care managers can keep track and update the information as is needed.
